# stock-analysis

## Project Overview
* In this project we will refactor the code generated for our stock analysis. This will allow us to expand our stock market data to include other years and companies without compromising the speed at which the code is run.
* Specifically we will be analyzing the improvements to the code, comparing the execution times of the original and refactored script, and lastly looking at stock performances for 2017 versus 2018.
